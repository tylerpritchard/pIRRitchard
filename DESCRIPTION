Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tyler R. Pritchard
Maintainer: Tyler <tyler.pritchard@uoguelph.ca>
Description: These series of functions are used to quickly calculate inter-rater reliability estimates (Fleiss's Kappa and Gwet's AC1) for many variables and raters. In addition, there are functions to 1) create a sample data.frame in wide-form to test the main function and 2) a quick plotting tool.
